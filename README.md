Hi, I’m @drewbid4

I’m interested in developing databases using Python and SQL, working with APIs, and anything that involves data!

I am currently working FileMaker Pro Advanced, QuickBooks Desktop, and SQL Server at my job.  I want to use SQL Server as a centralized repository to improve analytics and performance of our ERP.

If you are interested in similar work or want help on a project, reach out to me via email at adbiddle2@gmail.com
